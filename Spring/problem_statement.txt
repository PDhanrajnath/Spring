Customers come to a restaurant and order dishes for lunch. Pay the bill and go home. create an app for a restaurant where
1. Waiter can see orders to be served to customers,
2. Manager should be able to generate the bill of a particular customer.
3. Restaurant owner can see all the amount he made  in that particular date range(month, or by day or by week).  

Assume there is a single restaurant and single branch only. Come up with your own tables, classes and apis in spring boot.

Expectation is the assignment should be demonstrated by curl/postman. All apis can be accessed by everyone: manager,waiter and restaurant owner. Use appropriate data structures and helper functions. The code is neat and aligned with our clean code standards.  The code is committed to Git. 

Bonus : 

Unit tested code.
